# History of Liverpool horse racing and the Grand National
The Grand National is a horse race held every spring at Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool.  A major sporting event followed all around the world, it is popular amongst many people who do not normally watch, or bet, on horse racing at any other time of the year.  It is a Handicap Steeplechase run over 4 miles 514 yards, this a reduced race distance from the historical 4 miles 880 yards, but is still the longest National Hunt race in Britain, with horses jumping 30 fences over two circuits.
The reduced distance is because after the 2012 running, the start was moved further forward away from the crowds and grandstands as part of a safety review.  Also, in 2015 a new measuring method replaced a surveyor's wheel in the mid-point of the course, with a more accurate assessment taken two yards outside the inner rail position.
It is also notable for having one of the longest run-ins from the final fence of any steeplechase, at 494 yards, and is the most valuable jump race in Europe, with a prize fund of £1 million in 2016.
The race features much larger fences than those found on conventional National Hunt tracks.  Many of these, particularly Becher's Brook, The Chair, and the Canal Turn, have become famous in their own right, and combined with the distance of the event, create what has been called "the ultimate test of horse and rider".
The Grand National has been broadcast live on radio since 1927, with the BBC holding exclusive rights up until 2013, but now Talksport also hold radio commentary rights. The BBC also broadcasted live television coverage of the race from 1960 until 2012.  Between 2013 and 2016 it was shown by Channel 4, but the UK broadcasting rights transfer to ITV from 2017.  An estimated 500 to 600 million people watch the Grand National in over 140 countries around the world.

## Early History
Local flat racing took place as early as 1577 on a course from Crosby to Bankhall, held on Ascension Day, the trophy raced for then was a Silver Bell donated by Edward Torbuck.

#### Thursday 26th May 1577  -  Crosby Silver Bell  (ran over 4½ miles)
1st	unnamed horse  -  owned by Mr Bramhall
2nd	unnamed horse  -  owned by Mr Sutton
3rd	unnamed horse  -  owned by Edward Torbuck

Although no mention of a further running of the Crosby Silver Bell exists, races in Little and Great Crosby continued, albeit it on more of a purpose built course adjacent to Crosby Marshes.
The English Civil War lasted from 1642 to 1651 and put paid to any races taking place in the town during this period of unrest. However, shortly after the end of the War prominent supporters of the meeting, notably Viscount Richard Molyneux and his family were keen to re-establish the races, and Richard attended Crosby races regularly right up to his death in 1654. The Viscounts later gained the title of The Earl of Sefton.
The ‘History of Lancashire’ recorded that a diary kept by Nicholas Blundell of Great Crosby noted: ‘On 3rd April 1704 I saw a race on Crosby Marsh between Mr Hay’s mare and a horse of Mr Molyneux from Liverpool’.  His diary later noted: ‘Again on 1st July 1704 I went to Crosby Races; there were 5 starters for the plate and a mare of Maikins of Prescot won it’.

#### October 1730  -  Crosby 25 Guineas Plate
1st	Ticklepitcher  -  owned by Lord Derby
2nd	Terror  -  owned by Sir R. Grosvenor
3rd	unnamed grey mare owned  -  by Mr Bates
4th	Vulcan  -  owned by Mr Egerton

Racing ceased at Crosby for a period of about 40 years from the mid 1730’s until 1774, race organisers then returned with renewed vigour and held a 3 day meeting in the summer of that year, which, for the first time, included a dedicated grandstand for spectators, with a Race Ball organised for each evening.  The final meeting at the Crosby Marsh course took place in 1786.

In 1827 a local farmer John Formby Esq, and his wife Helen, joint owners of Maghull Hall and its estate, re-established racing in the area by holding flat racing on their agricultural land, which unfortunately could be affected dramatically by heavy rain.
The inaugural three day meeting started well on Wednesday 25th July 1827, but then there was torrential rain overnight and all the next day, turning the ground into a marsh, making the conditions for competitors and spectators farcically atrocious, with people wading ankle deep in mud and water.
At the following year’s three day meeting from Wednesday 23rd to Friday 25th July 1828 the first two days went well, but again incessant rain returned on the final day, bringing with it marshy ground and further problems for John Formby.

For both of these first two years William Lynn, proprietor of the Waterloo Hotel in Liverpool, who had earlier instigated the Waterloo Cup hare coursing event, rented the 'grandstand' from John Formby, and what with the weather being so bad and everybody looking for shelter, Lynn must of made a lot of money from sales of food and drink, as there were upwards of 25,000 people there.

At the 1828 meeting Lynn also sponsored a race, The Waterloo Gold Cup, for 100 guineas, and used the opportunity to meet and gain support, from the well-off and better connected sporting community, for his idea of staging races at another venue.

On 10th September 1828 Lynn tried to buy a controlling interest in the Maghull racecourse through Peter Bretherton (a coach proprietor from Lydiate), and Thomas Jackson (from Cumberland), who since February 1827 were the 11 year lease holders, at a cost of £250 per year, of the 25 acres of land owned by John Formby that the course was built on.  However, he was not successful in this enterprise.
Richard Willis (Maghull racecourse steward) then called a meeting to form a Racing Committee, which included some members of the Altcar Club (Hare Coursing Committee). One of the rules of this club was that they were to always meet for dinner at The Waterloo Hotel at 6pm on the day preceding each hare coursing event. Membership of the Altcar Club included William Philip Molyneux (2nd Earl of Sefton).

It was this committee that pressured Formby by stating that he must comply to their demands to improve the running of the meeting, including costly alterations and improvements to the racecourse, or the racing would be switched to a new venue.
It appears, that whether or not he met their demands, racing at Aintree was going to go ahead anyway, as the Racing Committee favoured and encouraged William Lynn to stage a July fixture at the new site.

Leasing some land at Aintree from Lord Sefton, Lynn set out a course, built a grandstand, and staged the first fixture there on Tuesday 7th July 1829, although at this time it was for flat racing only.  Lord Sefton had earlier laid the foundation stone on Saturday 7th February 1829.
From then on, both the Maghull and Aintree meetings took place. A spring meeting was held at Maghull in May, and a summer meeting was held at Aintree in July.
The final meeting at Maghull was in May 1835, and racing came to an end later that year, when John Formby went out of business.  This was for three main reasons. First, William Lynn and Aintree racecourse had the strong financial backing of Lord Sefton and the Racing Committee. Second, the Aintree meeting in July was unrivalled on the racing calendar, whereas the Maghull meeting clashed with the famous Chester meeting. Third, the quality of the turf at Aintree was lush and springy, in comparison to Maghull's marshy and swamp-like surface.
William Lynn purchased the rights for the May meeting, and subsequent meetings were transferred to Aintree, where he held three meetings a year. All the racing being well liked, he experimented by expanding the amount of hurdling races, and during 1835 he set aside a whole race meeting just for hurdles. This proved very successful and not being one to stand on his laurels he soon got the idea of holding a steeplechase much like the Great St. Albans Steeplechase which was popular at the time.
He published the conditions of his new steeplechase to be held on 29th February 1836:

##### A sweepstakes of 10 sovereigns, each with 80 sovereigns added, for horses of all denominations, 12 stone each, gentlemen riders, second horse receives back his stake.  Winner to be sold for 200 sovereigns, if demanded.

This was an incredible success, a local journal wrote of: "immense crowds many of whom has brought their own telescopes" proving they were there to watch the racing and not simply there for the event.
There is not a lot of information about the race, but it was over 20 fences, two circuits of the course, with two flights of hurdles in the straight. There were 10 runners and the victor on the day was ‘The Duke’ ridden by Captain Martin Becher, the fence Becher's Brook is named after him, when he fell into the Brook in the 1839 race.

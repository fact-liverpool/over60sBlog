# Digital Exhibition

On Wednesday 22nd June, Alan and I were invited to an exhibition at FACT, or should I sat Mr Hartley and myself (see our Tagging Communities project to get that joke!) 

This exhibition gave us an insight into new and not so new digital design.

2 or possibly 3 particular items caught my eye, firstly the typewriters. I, myself used something like them over 40 years ago. I was not very good mind, no change there.

Secondly ‘The Digital travelling suitcases’ which were first used and designed for people at a housing estate in London. The suitcase, consisted of a hand phone connected to a recording device with two or three cubed blocks, these when inserted would hold and store information for the tenant or staff of the social housing building and for people in the local area.

The final item ‘Digital Recordings’ from your mobile phone. After picking music on your phone, you pick up a disc, only as big as the tip on the end of a snooker cue, slide is slowly on the back of the phone and this disc will hold and download whatever you are playing. Fascinating. It is a new way at looking at a mix tape! 

There is also a wristband that will hold about seven of these discs allowing you to carry them with you or over to Mr Hartley. 

What Alan wanted to know was what would happen would these prototypes, would they ever become real items or would technology already be out of date by the time the product comes out? The group are exploring what they can make with 3D printing at the moment and this is our biggest question whilst exploring topic, what to make, who for and why?

# Virtual Reality Headsets
Fact’s Over 60’s group have been working with sensory and immersive technologies to find out how it can benefit older people. Most recently they have been working with Virtual Reality Headsets and discussing how this technology could change our lives.

The group started exploring virtual realities with virtual reality headsets using their phones and experienced for themselves how immersive this technology can be.

"The cardholders we used to hold mobile phones for viewing the 360° movies were quite flimsy and had to be held. Although the new plastic moulded ones which are now available are much better; leaving your hands free which enhances the viewing experience"
Dave W - Digital Ambassador

Each of the group was given a cardboard headset that they could construct and keep. The group could take it home and use with virtual reality videos they found online to show their family and friends. The next project will be to create a film using the 360° camera which the group can watch at home using their headsets.

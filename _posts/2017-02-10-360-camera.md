# 360 Degree Camera
Fact’s Over 60’s group have been working with sensory and immersive technologies to find out how it can benefit older people. Most recently they have been working with 360° degree cameras and videos and discussing how this technology could change our lives.

The group then used this technology to create a short film touring Sarah Sparkes’ artwork, Ghost, at FACT’s current exhibition No Such Thing as Gravity so that people who cannot attend the gallery are able to see the artwork. See a video of their tour here.

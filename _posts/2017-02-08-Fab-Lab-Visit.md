### Group visit – Wed 22nd June 2016

Fab Lab – A digital Fabrication Laboratory is a physical space located in the school of art and design at L.J.M.U. the school provides access to students and staff to the tools to educate, innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make almost anything.

The lab capabilities include:
•	3D printing
•	CNC Milling Machine
•	Circuit Production
•	Laser Cutting/Engraving
•	Precision Milling
•	Vinyl Plotter

After a session of 3D printing at FACT Wood Street the group were invited to Fab Lab at L.J.M.U organised by Liz Wewiora (FACT community officer) and Lawrence Baker who manages the Fabrication Laboratory.

Following a friendly introduction, explaining the purpose and workings of the lab and a very interesting question and answer period between Lawrence and ourselves, which led to us discovering that there are many fab labs around the world. We learnt that 3D printing had been developing since the 1980s and especially made advancements in the U.S with the department within M.I.T (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) playing a key role in its increased use and capabilities.

Despite this, the fact that the amazing number and intricate shapes that can be produced seems endless, there does not seem to be a commercial production line, even though the potential is huge. However one seems to be taking shape and in the medical profession providing a transformation in the diagnosis of problems with human organs without surgery is all ready under way.

A really interesting day with thanks to Lawrence and Liz,  the group look forward to further visits to the Fab Lab.
